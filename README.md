# SpongeMeme-SquareGIFs
An interactive, customizable, SpongeBob-themed(-memed) GIF page. Makes use of the GIPHY API.

You can add GIPHY search buttons by typing your search term and clicking the "I'M READY" button. Then, click on your button to summon a dozen SpongeBob GIFs based on what you typed! There are ten preset buttons to choose from as well:

1. "SpongeBob"
2. "Patrick"
3. "Squidward"
4. "Mr Krabs"
5. "Plankton"
6. "Sandy"
7. "Mrs Puff"
8. "Larry"
9. "Band Geeks"
10. "campfire"

*NB: The GIFs will not animate until you click on them!* You can toggle the animation on and off with repeated clicks.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

* characters (e.g., Gary, Pearl)
* locations (e.g., Bikini Bottom, Glove World)
* favorite episodes (e.g., "Pizza Delivery," "Chocolate with Nuts")
* objects (e.g., clarinet, bubbles)
* animals (e.g., jellfish, gorilla)

If nautical nonsense be something you wish, then visit the page and fill it with fish (or anything else from *SpongeBob Squarepants*)!
